# Emergency Preparedness

The goal of this repository is to have an updating source of information for emergency preparedness. The goal isn't to
make any recommendations for what you should do personally, but instead to disseminate information so that you can
decide what is best. As you should do with all sources of information, make sure to verify against other sources to
ensure we aren't out of date or missing the latest technology.
