# Electricity Preparedness

This directory is meant to store information on some possible ways to handle an emergency situation where electricity
becomes a scarce resource. Below we list out our personal checklists for different preparedness states, with more
detailed information accessible by clicking the link for the term. Note that you should do your own research and
assessment of your own situation to determine what makes the most sense for yourself.

## [Short Term (Few Hours)](docs/shortTerm.md)

This section is a little different from the others as it isn't really about "surviving" for a few hours, as that is
relatively easy to do unless you are facing the most drastic conditions. Instead, what we mean to do here is make a list
of things you might need in order to get yourself a few hours of power to implement your escape plan. The most obvious
situation would be your power goes out right after you fall asleep, which also means right after you plug in your nearly
dead phone for a charge. When you wake up you have no battery and no power, so how do you figure out whether you need to
stay put and wait it out, or make your escape? That is what this section is for.

* [ ] Portable Solar Generator
* [ ] Car Battery to USB Power Inverter

## [Medium Term (Day to a Week)](docs/mediumTerm.md)

This section has a list of things that can help you generate a portion of the general power usage you have for a few
days. Nothing here can fully replace a working electric grid, but can hopefully buy you some time if you believe the
grid will be coming back "any day now".

* [ ] Gas/Diesel Powered Generator
* [ ] Solar Powered Generator

## [Long Term (Weeks to Months)](docs/longTerm.md)

This section is a list of things that can help you generate all or almost all of your power in the event the grid fails
for multiple days/weeks. None of the power generators here can produce constant power, so the suggestion is to bundle
them with some form of high capacity energy storage for the cases where power is not being generated.

* [ ] Solar Panels/Solar Roof
* [ ] Battery Wall
* [ ] Windmill or Other Constant Energy Source
