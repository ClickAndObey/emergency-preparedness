# Food Preparedness

This directory is meant to store information on some possible ways to handle an emergency situation where food becomes a
scarce resource. Below we list out our personal checklists for different preparedness states, with more detailed
information accessible by clicking the link for the term. Note that you should do your own research and assessment of
your own situation to determine what makes the most sense for yourself.

## [Short Term (1 to 3 days)](docs/shortTerm.md)

This section is meant to cover the scenario where you have a "long" term power outage, most likely during a storm or
other scenario where you can't easily get access to the food you need.

## [Medium Term (4+ days to a couple of weeks)](docs/mediumTerm.md)

This section has a lot of overlap with the short term, but starts to get in to whether the food you have stored away is
actually something you will eat. Storing dry goods is great in concept, but if you can't stomach the taste, then that
space, money, and time could be spent better elsewhere.

* [ ] Food Being stored is part of normal diet rotation (i.e. You don't store it too long, and actually eat it.)
* [ ] Food Being stored is in a good location for storage.
  * [ ] Space isn't more useful for something else.
  * [ ] Space has good airflow and won't get too hot/cold.

## [Long Term (Weeks to Months)](docs/longTerm.md)

This section is a list of things that can help you generate a portion of your food to minimize what you either need to
be storing, or make sure that you have enough to survive on in the worst case scenario.

* [ ] Growing some portion of your food supply.
* [ ] Know people who grow/have access to food you will not, so you can barter/trade.
