# Water Preparedness

This directory is meant to store information on some possible ways to handle an emergency situation where water,
specifically clean and consumable water, becomes a scarce resource.

## [Short Term (1 to 3 days)](docs/shortTerm.md)

This section is meant to cover the scenario where you have a "long" term water outage or potentially a water treatment
facility has gone offline. Most likely during a storm or other scenario where you can't easily get access to the water
or at least the clean water you need.

* [ ] 10-15 Gallons drinkable water. (Depends on how many people you need to provide for over how many days)
* [ ] 10-15 Gallons sanitation water for cleaning self/food. (Depends on how many people you need to provide for over
      how many days)
* [ ] Water Filtration Unit that can turn "any" water into drinkable water.

## [Medium Term (4+ days to a couple of weeks)](docs/mediumTerm.md)

This section has a lot of overlap with the short term, but greatly increases the amount of water you would need to store
and begins to look at water collection methods as well.

* [ ] 30-60 Gallons drinkable water. (Depends on how many people you need to provide for over how many days)
* [ ] 30-60 Gallons sanitation water for cleaning self/food. (Depends on how many people you need to provide for over
      how many days)
* [ ] Water Filtration Unit that can turn "any" water into drinkable water.
* [ ] Water Collection source like a rain collector.

## [Long Term (Weeks to Months)](docs/longTerm.md)

This section is a list of things that you would need to essentially be water self-sufficient. This isn't meant as a
suggestion of course, but a list of what you *could* do.

* [ ] Massive Rain Collection Basin (200+ Gallons)
* [ ] Have a well or pond on your property.

## Containment

Information specifically about how to store water both in a small or large capacity.

* [Less than 10 Gallon Containers](docs/containment/lessThan10GallonContainers.md)

## Filtration

Information specifically about how to filter your water to ensure it is as clean (and probably tasty) as possible.

* [Portable Water Filtration](docs/filtration/portableWaterFiltration.md)
* [House Water Filtration](docs/filtration/houseWaterFiltration.md)
