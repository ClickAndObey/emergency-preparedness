# Less than 10 Gallon Containers

For containing less than 10 gallons of water in a specific container, not necessarily in a location there are several
options that will be listed below. They range from being measured in oz and not needing to prep, to gallons and in need
of preperation.

## Water Bottles

You can find these almost anywhere (assuming there isn't a water crisis) in sizes ranging from 8 oz - 2 liters. Typical
cost for an individual unit is anywhere from $1 to $3 (once again assuming there isn't a water crisis). Buying in bulk
generally gets the cost down to about $1 a liter.

### Pros

Already treated, so just buy and store. Make sure to use by the use by date and rotate when necessary, but overall
pretty easy to acquire and store.

### Cons

Upfront cost isn't that high, but over time this is probably the most costly option, not to mention the environmental
impact of using that much plastic.

## Water Buckets/Tanks

If you are looking for something with more capacity, getting a water bucket/tank can give you 3 to 7 gallons per unit
pretty easily, but you will need to make sure you buy the right kind, and sanitize both the water and bucket/tank before
storage. If you use plastic, make sure you get food grade, BPA free plastic. If you use glass, make sure you have a way
to ensure it doesn't break. If you go with a metal container, choose stainless steel with a bladder/coating to minimize
potential degradation.

### Pros

Stores a lot more water per unit, so easier to manage a significant amount. Long term costs are lower since you have the
initial cost of the container, but then you can use tap water (likely with some treatment) to store.

### Cons

Prep work is almost guaranteed to be necessary. Even if you didn't prep the container and poured tap water directly in,
when you get it out, you will want to run the water through a filter to ensure its quality. Note the
[Portable Water Filtration](../filtration/portableWaterFiltration.md) guide for information on how you **could** utilize
this strategy, even though it is not a recommended one.
